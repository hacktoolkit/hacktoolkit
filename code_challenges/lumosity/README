Let's pretend you are one of our customers in Familiar
Faces (http://www.lumosity.com/brain-games/memory-games/familiar-faces).
You've unlocked all the levels of Familiar Faces and now can go to any
restaurant of your choosing.  You are hungry and looking for the most
affordable place to buy your meal.

For each meal, you will be provided a CSV file of restaurant menus. The
file's format is:

for lines that define a price for a single item:
restaurant ID, price, item name

for lines that define the price for a combo meal (there can be any
number of items in a combo meal)
restaurant ID, price, item 1 name, item 2 name, ...

All restaurant IDs are integers, all item names are lower case
letters and underscores, and the price is a decimal number.


Write a Ruby class that accepts the restaurant menus and outputs
the restaurant and total cost of the meal the user should go to, based
on the most affordable option. It is ok to purchase extra items, as
long as the total cost is minimized.

Here are some sample menu lists, example inputs, and the expected result:

1) menus1.csv
------------
1, 4.00, ham_sandwich
1, 8.00, burrito
2, 5.00, ham_sandwich
2, 6.50, burrito

input
> program menus1.csv ham_sandwich burrito

expected output
=> 2, 11.5
---------------------------



2) menus2.csv
------------
3, 4.00, blt_sandwich
3, 8.00, chicken_wings
4, 5.00, chicken_wings
4, 2.50, coffee

input
> program menus2.csv blt_sandwich coffee

expected output
=> nil  (as there is no single restaurant that satisfies your desires)
---------------------------


3) menus3.csv
------------
5, 4.00, fish_sandwich
5, 8.00, milkshake
6, 5.00, milkshake
6, 6.00, fish_sandwich, blue_berry_muffin, chocolate_milk

input
> program menus3.csv milkshake fish_sandwich

expected output
=> 6, 11.0
