Welcome to the IO wargame at the smash the stack network.
---------------------------------------------------------

You have done the hard part and found our realm. Here you are able to play with
classic, and up to date vulnerabilities in software. Since many of you may be
unfamiliar with how a wargame works, the following paragraphs explain the basics
of how a challenge based wargame works. If you are familiar with all this already
you can skip to the last section, which lists all the IO specific information.

The problems are presented to you as a series of programs. They will vary
in size from a few lines containing an obvious bug, over to larger, and finally
real software. The point is usually to exploit this bug in such a way that you
can control the program's execution in such a way that you are able to read the
password file for the next level.

The way this works is that the programs are "SUID binaries"
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid). This means in short that they run with the
privileges of the "owner" of the binary rather than the privileges of the user
executing it. It are these extra privileges you need to read the password file
to access the next level.


How to get started
------------------

Currently you are "level1" user. 
This means you can access only files that are owned by level1, or are accessible
by everybody. (or accessible to one of the groups you belong)

  level1@io:~# cd /levels
  level1@io:/levels# ls -las level01
  8 -r-sr-x--- 1 level2 level1 7500 Nov 16  2007 level01

When you run it will ask you for a password. Which you must somehow find.
Given the correct password it will launch a new shell with level2 rights.

  level1@io:/levels$ ./level01 [something you have to figure out goes here]
  Win.
  level1@io:/levels$ id
  uid=1001(level1) gid=1001(level1) euid=1002(level2) groups=1001(level1),1029(nosu)
                                    -----------------
                                            \_________> new privileges

as you can see, by the output of the "id" command you now have euid (effective user id)
of level2. You can now read files that belong to level2. The point is to use this right
to read the password file for the next level.

  level1@io:/levels$ cat /home/level2/.pass
  [BINGO YOU DID IT]

Now you have the level2 password. You can now login as level2. Disconnect the current
connection. Login as level2 and use the password you just found. When you do this
You'll notice that you are level2. At this point you may want to tell the world of
your achievement. And you can do so by adding your tag, comment, or pretty much
anything you want to the tags file. For example by using the following command
  level2@io:~$ echo "<p>superleetzor was here and pwnd level1</p>" >> tags

This will then become visible online at:
http://io.smashthestack.org:84/tags/level2.html

And that's pretty much it. We allow pretty much everything in the tags files. So feel free
to be creative. Though use some common sense. Also disable javascript when you view these
files in a browser...


FAQ
---

Q: I'm very new to all this, will I be able to solve this game? Is it hard?
A: Well it's a staged game. The first stage which lasts about to level10 is
   relatively simple. You should be able to solve these levels regardless of
   your background, age, sex, ... If you are willing to persevere and ask
   for a little bit of help. After that point you will have had the pleasure
   of learning the basics pretty well. The game then moves on to slightly
   more advanced levels. There is no shame in getting stuck here, and asking
   for some help or guidance. Or just leave it be for the time being.
   Smashthestack has been and will continue to be stable for at least the
   foreseeable future.

Q: Is there somewhere I can write files?
A: Yes, you can write in the /tmp directory.
   However this directory is set up in such a way that you can not
   list the files that are present. This is done so you can't easily
   access the files other players are working on. You are encouraged
   to make your own subdirectory to work in. For example by issueing
   the following commands.

   mkdir /tmp/somethinghardtoguess
   cd /tmp/somethinghardtoguess

   you can now write list, store temporary files, and whatnot in this
   directory. We will periodically clear out this directory whenever
   the needs arise. This will usually be announced in the chat room.
   however it's typically a good idea to have a local backup of your
   work.

Q: Do you have a list of papers i can read for level X?
A: Typically there are some things you can read, but there no level
   specific list. Feel free to try you luck in the chatroom with that
   question. Though independent research and figuring out what the
   problem is part of the game. And hence you will not always be
   provided with a say all document. IO is not a comprehensive reading
   test.

Q: Why can't i use su?
A: Su ties up processes. For no good reason. And since we aim to keep
   the box stable for everybody we limit the amount of processes.
   Hence to prevent problems we disable su, and require you to reconnect.

Q: Why can't i use nano, vim, ... to edit the tags file?
A: The tags files are set to "append only", and due to something called
   the editor bug, editors tend to rewrite portions of the file at once
   instead of appending. You will have to use the append (>>) output
   redirector.

Q: I really like this readme, do you want me to translate it?
A: Sure, feel free to log on to our IRC or email it to somebody. There
   should be email addresses in the motd.

Q: I'm trying hard to learn, but any shellcode i try or test still segfaults wth?!
A: You are probably compiling the levels or your testcode manually without taking
into consideration that some sections of memory are not executable by
default. This is the current setting and we have no intention of hiding
this from the players.Most of the levels on this game have an exectable stack.
There are several reasons for this. Mainly because the
workarounds to bypass certain protections are too cumbersome
to be worked into each level.
The later levels do touch on these topics.

When you want to test shellcode you can use code similar to the one
included below in order to test:

#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

char sc[]= "your shellcode here";

int main(){
        void * a = mmap(0, 4096, PROT_EXEC |PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_SHARED, -1, 0);
        printf("allocated executable memory at: %p\n", a);
        ((void (*)(void)) memcpy(a, sc, sizeof(sc)))();
}


Q: Why does this document contain so many spelling errors?
A: It was written by bla.



Game specifics
--------------

- levels are in the directory /levels
- passwords are stored in the home directory for the level, in a file called .pass.
  for example /home/level2/.pass contains the password for the user "level2"
