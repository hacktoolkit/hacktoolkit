Efficient exponentiation

The most naive way of computing n15 requires fourteen multiplications:
n  n  ...  n = n15
But using a "binary" method you can compute it in six multiplications:
n  n = n2
n2  n2 = n4
n4  n4 = n8
n8  n4 = n12
n12  n2 = n14
n14  n = n15
However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:
n  n = n2
n2  n = n3
n3  n3 = n6
n6  n6 = n12
n12  n3 = n15
We shall define m(k) to be the minimum number of multiplications to compute nk; for example m(15) = 5.
For 1  k  200, find  m(k).
