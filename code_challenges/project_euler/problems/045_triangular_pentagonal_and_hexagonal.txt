Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:


Triangle     Tn=n(n+1)/2     1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal   Pn=n(3n-1)/2    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal    Hn=n(2n-1)      1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.
Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
