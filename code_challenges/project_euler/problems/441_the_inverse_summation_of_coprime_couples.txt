The inverse summation of coprime couples


For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p·q) for all the integer pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:


 1  p  q  M
 p + q  M
 p and q are coprime.


We also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2  i  N.
We can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10)  6.9147 and S(100)  58.2962.


Find S(107). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
