Sum of digits - experience #23


For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.
Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.


For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k n with the following properties :

k is divisible by 23 and
d(k) = 23.


You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.


Find S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.
