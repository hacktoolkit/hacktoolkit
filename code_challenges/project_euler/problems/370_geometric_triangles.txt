Geometric triangles


Let us define a geometric triangle as an integer sided triangle with sides a  b  c so that its sides form a geometric progression, i.e. b2 = a · c . 
An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides a = 144, b = 156 and c = 169.
There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter  106 .
How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter  2.5·1013 ?
