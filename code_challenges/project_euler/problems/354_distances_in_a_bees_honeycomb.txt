Distances in a bee's honeycomb 

Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.




One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.
For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. 
For example, B(3) = 6, B(21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.
Find the number of L  5·1011 such that B(L) = 450.
