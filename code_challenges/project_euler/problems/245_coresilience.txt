Coresilience

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4⁄11.



The resilience of a number d  1 is then
φ(d)
d - 1, where φ is Euler's totient function.




We further define the coresilience of a number n  1 as C(n)= 
n - φ(n)

n - 1.


The coresilience of a prime p is C(p)
= 
1p - 1.




Find the sum of all composite integers 1  n  21011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
