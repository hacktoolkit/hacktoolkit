Integer-valued polynomials


It can be shown that the polynomial n4 + 4n3 + 2n2 + 5n is a multiple of 6 for every integer n. It can also be shown that 6 is the largest integer satisfying this property.


Define M(a, b, c) as the maximum m such that n4 + an3 + bn2 + cn is a multiple of m for all integers n. For example, M(4, 2, 5) = 6.


Also, define S(N) as the sum of M(a, b, c) for all 0  a, b, c  N.


We can verify that S(10) = 1972 and S(10000) = 2024258331114.


Let Fk be the Fibonacci sequence:
F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and
Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 for k  2.


Find the last 9 digits of Σ S(Fk) for 2  k  1234567890123.
