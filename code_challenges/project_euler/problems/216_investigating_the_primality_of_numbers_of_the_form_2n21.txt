Investigating the primality of numbers of the form 2n2-1

Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n  1.
The first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.
It turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.
For n  10000 there are 2202 numbers t(n)  that are prime.
How many numbers t(n) are prime for n  50,000,000 ?
