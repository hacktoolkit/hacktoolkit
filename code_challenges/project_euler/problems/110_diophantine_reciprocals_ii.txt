Diophantine reciprocals II

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.



1 x
 + 
1 y
 = 
1 n



It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?
NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
