Angular Bisectors


Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a  b  c. 
(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).
The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).





The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.
It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.
However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.


How many triangles ABC with perimeter100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?
