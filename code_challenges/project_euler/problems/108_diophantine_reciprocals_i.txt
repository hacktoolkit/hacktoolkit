Diophantine reciprocals I

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.



1 x
 + 
1 y
 = 
1 n



For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:



1 5
 + 
1 20
 = 
1 4


1 6
 + 
1 12
 = 
1 4


1 8
 + 
1 8
 = 
1 4



What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
NOTE: This problem is an easier version of problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
