Best Approximations

Let x be a real number.
A best approximation to x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s in reduced form, with s  d, such that any rational number which is closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:
|p/q-x|  |r/s-x|  q  d
For example, the best approximation to 13 for the denominator bound 20 is 18/5 and the best approximation to 13 for the denominator bound 30 is 101/28.
Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to n for the denominator bound 1012, where n is not a perfect square and 1  n  100000.
