Modified Fibonacci golden nuggets

Consider the infinite polynomial series AG(x) = xG1 + x2G2 + x3G3 + ..., where Gk is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation Gk = Gk1 + Gk2, G1 = 1 and G2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .
For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which AG(x) is a positive integer.
The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.



xAG(x)


(51)/41


2/52


(222)/63


(1375)/144


1/25



We shall call AG(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.
Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.
